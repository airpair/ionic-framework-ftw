**Summary:** Start developing mobile apps with Ionic now! And take advantage using the hints we give you in this article.
 
Creating hybrid mobile apps using web technologies can’t get any better. Ionic offers a free and open source, with components of CSS, JS, mobile optimized HTML, as well as gestures and tools needed to build high end apps with amazing user friendliness. Ionic is built using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) and is optimized for handling [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

Ionic works to enrich user interface and uses AngularJS to construct a functional application structure. This gives you a mix of power and beauty. For those developers who enjoy attractive UI frameworks where demos look real, Ionic will definitely offer more than that. Ionic also adds some Angular directives, enriching your app development with series of easy-to-use widgets. The available directives give room for addition of common UX solutions such as ‘pull to refresh’, ‘scrollable panes’, ‘infinite scroll’, and lots more. This simply means you don’t stay out of the UX solutions when using Ionic.

It doesn’t end there! If you want to build Cordova (phoneGap) apps, Ionic can be used as a platform for that. The CLI, which is a major tool in Ionic, is optimized to work with Cordova projects. That is, there is a connection between the Ionic commands given by the CLI, and Cordova CLI commands. Cordova developers are usually dazed by the power and functionality they get when this combination is used for projects.

You can’t be disappointed with the UI provided by Ionic. This is one of its many high sides. It gets more beautiful because you get to use the capabilities of both CSS3 and HTML5 for an amazing experience. The speed you get from Ionic is mind-blowing. You might be surprised at the look of its UI but you can be sure to get a very fast and steady interface. It has been reported that Ionic helps you get the best from devices that are usually slow in rendering HTML5 applications.

## <a name="ionic-extensibility">Extensibility</a>
Developers love to be in charge, we love to see our true brain child as we perceived it during the architectural stage of the development. Ionic offers you extensively customizable appearance. You will enjoy the mixins and other handy variables that come with Ionic. It also has a unique open source library of icons, providing more than 440 icons from which you can select. You can take a step ahead by creating Angular directives and controllers. Here comes the superpowers of Ionic! Don’t fret if you are new at developing apps with Angular and Ionic, it’s not as difficult as you think – You don’t need any special ability.

Using Ionic to develop hybrid apps gives you the advantage of accessing the native API’s of devices, including the geolocation, device camera, touchID, push notification, and so on. When developing an Ionic app, you can have several device API’s integrated using ngCordova. That’s the difference between mobile web and hybrid apps.

## <a name="what-you-will-find-using-ionic">What you will find</a>
For **developers**, this is the time to save your expensive time and write less code for your new app. You can build a rich app with Ionic in a very straightforward way. Your knowledge about using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript will help serve as the building blocks of your app. Ionic also has lots of tutorials you can use.
 
For **designers**, customization of layout has no limit with Ionic. You don’t even have to modify a complicated widget. It is pretty clean and simple to start your own customization and create a satisfactory design.

For all of you in addition to what ionic offers you will find a wonderful and active community, its popularity is skyrocketing, as today (april 2015) is THE go to solution if you want to build hybrid apps. And every day are popping new components and features.

## <a name="ionic-hints-and-tips">Hints & Tips</a>
You thought it couldn’t get any faster? Follow these tips:

### \#1 Find a good starter project/template
Besides ionic provides its own ready-made app templates (blank app, app with tabs navigation, and side menu navigation app), they lack all the goodies and requirements of a real mobile app (Geolocation, Push Notifications, Camera access, AdMob, iAd, Facebook, Google Analytics, In App Browser, Instagram, Social Sharing, Twitter, Google, etc).

Never mind, there are super complete starter projects and app templates around the corner. 
Two of my favourites are [IonFullApp](http://codecanyon.net/item/ionfullapp-ionic-phonegapcordova-full-hybrid-app/10400343?ref=recommended_for_you) and [IonWordpress](http://codecanyon.net/item/ionwordpress-wordpress-full-integrated-mobile-app/10639789?ref=recommended_for_you). The first one is a well designed and beautifull template for you to start, and comes with lots of goodies, the second one is a ready to use Full Wordpress Integrated app both for Android and iOS. You just need to add some plugins to your Wordpress site and the app will do the rest.

### \#2 Get a five stars professional design
If you want to go a little bit further you can also get an awesome design for your app at [99designs](http://99designs.com/mobile-app-design).

### \#3 Backend?
So far so good, but what about the backend part of the story? As you may know not all apps can live by its own. They need a backend to authenticate users, get products, posts, etc. The way your backend will communicate with your app is through an API.

Having that in mind, in my opinion you have three alternatives here:

1. You can use all mighty **Wordpress** as your backend
    - Wordpress is very flexible and you can use it in many ways, as a blog, a cms, or ecommerce (using woocommerce for example), etc. Also there are tons of plugins that will help you add different functionalities.
    - You can easily access your Wordpress content through it’s JSON API.
    - This is a fast and general solution, so depending on what your are planning to build you may need something more powerful and custom.
2. Use **Parse** or **Firebase** (both “backends as a service”)
    - [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) is a great service that will help you build your app’s backend with ease. (owned by Google)
    - [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) is also another option which offers some of the same features as Firebase. (owned by Facebook)
    - Again depending on what your are planning to build you may need something more powerful.
3. If you are one of those who like to have strict control over the backend implementation, I suggest you to try **Strongloop**.
    - [Strongloop](https://strongloop.com/) is a perfect solution if you need full control and custom functionalities on your backend. Basically is a platform that enables you to easily (I would say VERY easily) build custom API’s for your backend needs. (This is the solution I use for my clients production apps).
